<h1>The Best Movies According to Dom</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
<br/>
<h3>Jurrasic Park</h3>
<p>A phenomenal blend of CGI and puppeteering that set the bar for all future sci-fi and creature movies going forward. </p>
<h3>Casa Blanca</h3>
<p>An instant classic that set the bar, not only for romance movies of its era, but for all films to come.</p>
<h3>Heat</h3>
<p>This film arguably, has the best shoot-out sceens ever produced in live-action cinema!</p>
